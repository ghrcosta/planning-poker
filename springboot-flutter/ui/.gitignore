# This file is generated by the Firebase plugin. It's required for the application to work, and it contains credential
# data. According to the documentation (https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#config-files-objects) it's
# safe to be made public -- as long as Firebase security rules are properly configured. At the same time, it also says
# that it's not recommended to add it to source control in public projects because anyone who downloads the code would
# need to remember to setup Firebase security rules as well. Also, Google sends an email warning about that if the file
# is pushed to GitHub. Therefore, it's better to ignore it here. To regenerate it, execute:
# $ cd <project_directory>/ui
# $ flutterfire configure
